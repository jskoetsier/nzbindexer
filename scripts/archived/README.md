# Archived Scripts

This directory contains old utility and debugging scripts that are no longer needed in the containerized environment.

These scripts were used during development and debugging for:
- Direct database manipulation
- Article processing fixes
- Binary detection debugging
- NNTP connection testing
- Legacy installations

## Note

All functionality from these scripts has been integrated into:
- The containerized application (`docker-compose.yml`)
- The utility script (`../utils.sh`)
- The web admin interface

These scripts are kept for reference only and may not work with the current version of the application.
